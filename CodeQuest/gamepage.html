                When you examine the code snippet above, you can see how Java is structured. You see a class definition starting with the expression "public class". Then comes the main function. This function is the starting point of a Java program, and it is called first when the program is executed. The "System.out.println" statement is used to print output to the screen.
                <br>Now it's your turn! Before we move on to our first question, carefully examine this clue and try to understand the basic structure of Java. This information will bring you one step closer to the treasure!
                
                <br>Are you ready? Then let's take a step into the magical world of Java and enjoy the adventure!
